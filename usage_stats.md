# What?

Some basic usage data is anonymized and sent to our datadog account.
It includes:

- Time spent on each screen of xcNav.
- Wind detector:
    - Time spent in dialog
    - Reset button presses
- Map view mode. (focus on me or group, edit spline, make measurement, etc)
- Error messages & crash reports.

# Why?

This helps tremendously while making decisions around UI design.
We can learn what is used the most, or what is never used. This that nobody uses can be removed or burried a little deeper while more important things are brought to the surface.

# Opt-out?

We respect your decision to opt-out of sending this basic data. You can do so from the settings menu.
However, error messages and crash reports will still be submitted automatically. (with anonymous ID)
